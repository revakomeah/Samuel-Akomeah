SERMONS QUICK GUIDE â€” Rev. Samuel Akomeah

Two ways to add messages:

A) JSON (Recommended for many sermons)
1) Open /sermons/sermons.json
2) Add a new object like this, separated by a comma:
   {
     "title": "New Message Title",
     "date": "Month YYYY",
     "youtube": "YouTubeVideoID",
     "audio": "resources/audio/your-file.mp3",
     "notes": "resources/notes/your-notes.pdf"
   }
3) Save and upload. The page will render it automatically.

How to find a YouTube ID:
- If your link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbCdEfGh, the ID is AbCdEfGh

B) Manual (One-off quick updates)
- Edit /sermons/manual-sermon.html
- Replace the embed IDs, audio path and notes path for each card

Files to replace with your real content:
- /resources/audio/*.mp3  (upload your real audio or use remote URLs)
- /resources/notes/*.pdf  (upload your sermon notes)

Publishing:
- Upload the whole folder to your GitHub repo (root).
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled (main branch / root).
- Visit your pages URL to see changes.
